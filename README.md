# Bigg-Boss-Winner-Prediction-using-ML-Techniques
This project predicts the winner of the Bigg Boss reality show using machine learning and past season data. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, trained a Random Forest model, and analyzed important features that affect the final result. The project helped me apply machine learning concepts to a real-world prediction problem.
